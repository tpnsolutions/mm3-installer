# mm3-installer

This project was created to implement a semi-automated installer for the Mailman 3 Suite for Debian 12 loosely using the Python Virtual Environment instructions found at [docs.mailman3.org](https://docs.mailman3.org/en/latest/install/virtualenv.html#virtualenv-install)

The installation should be run on a "fresh" system immediately after deployment, as we'll attempt to provision all aspects of your system with the intent on using this as a dedicated Mailman environment.
